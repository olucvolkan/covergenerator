# CV File ID Fix Implementation

This branch contains fixes for the "CV file_id is required" error that was occurring during cover letter generation.

## Files Changed

1. `lib/pdfParser.ts` - Improved file upload handling and database record creation
2. `app/api/generate-cover-letter/route.ts` - Enhanced error handling and validation
3. `components/CoverLetterGenerator.tsx` - Updated handling of file uploads and API calls

## For CoverLetterGenerator.tsx

The file `components/CoverLetterGenerator.tsx.part` contains the updated functions that need to be integrated into your existing component. You should update:

1. The `handleFileUpload` function
2. The `handleGenerateCoverLetter` function

Be careful to preserve any other customizations you have in the component.

## Testing

After applying these changes, test the CV upload and cover letter generation process to ensure the file ID is properly tracked and passed to the API.
